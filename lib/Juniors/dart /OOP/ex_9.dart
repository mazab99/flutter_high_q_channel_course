// what is Object In Dart  and give me some examples ( no code  ) ?

//In object-oriented programming, an object is a self-contained unit of code and data. Objects are created from templates called classes. An object is made up of properties(variables) and methods(functions). An object is an instance of a class.
// For example, a bicycle object might have attributes like color, size, and current speed. It might have methods like changeGear, pedalFaster, and brake.
